# Important to read this

This project is what I used to learn and master PHP! I built it while learning php. 
Please note that they are lot of way to develop this project with php. Since I'm learning, this is what I was able to do and build. 


As you can already tell, I used pure procedural PHP. Sometimes after doing something on this project, I might discover a new way of doing it, and then come back to edit it. Sometimes I don't edit all the part where I did something like that, please bear with me. 

If you're reading this readme file, it simply means you'll be workin' on this project, which is nice cause you're simply one of the best and you'll be helping me update and upgrade this project to a higher degree. Can't wait!

# The codes, OUR ISSUES

I try to add lines of comments to explain what I was trying to do on that file, or function. Sometimes I might now add commnets, sometimes my comments may not even explain what I did well, in this case, we'll have to  study the codes well to understand it. 

Since I'm not good at it yet, I'm pretty sure we'll have a hard time trying to crack and debug the codes so it can work well as expected. 

I'm sorry for the stress, no be send you make u be web developer lol!
